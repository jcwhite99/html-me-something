            <p>For 32 years there was just me.  Then all the sudden, one day my life changed forever.  I didn't know it at the time, 
               but I had met the love of my life.  Her name was Sam and she was amazing.  Soon after Sam and I met on POF we were inseperable.
               We would go to <a href="https://www.discoverstcharles.com/">Old Town St. Charles</a> together and out to dinner at <a href="http://www.pueblosolisstl.com">Pueblo Solis</a>.  It wasn't long before I realized Sam was the one.
               Long story short, I proposed, we got married, got a couple dogs and bought a house.</p>

            <p>Speaking of dogs, Sam and I have two.  Their names are Carl and Haystack and they are best friends.  Sam got Haystack from <a href="https://www.strayrescue.org ">Stray Rescue</a>
               before I met her.  Shortly after we were married we decided Haystack needed a friend.  We went back to Stray rescue and adopted Carl.  Carl and Haystack love to run and
               play at <a href="https://caninecountrykennel.com">Canine Country.</a>  They love to swim in the lake in the middle of the park.  Inevitably after a swim once they get in the car one or both will 
               sit in my spot so I have a wet seat the entire car trip home.</p>

            <p>Sam and I tried for a while to have childen but were never successful.  We heard about a fertility doctor at <a href="http://haveababy.com/fertility-clinics/st-louis-fertility-clinic">SIRM</a> and decided to
               make an appointment to see her.  We were told that to have a child we would need to go through IVF.  Another long story short, after
               one failed attempt we were pregnant.  Sam and I had a baby girl 9 months later.  We named her Eleanor Rosemary after Sams grandmothers. 
               Eleanor is quite tiny but she is the most perfect human being I have ever met.  There is no one on this earth more innocent or filled with 
               joy and love than that little girl.</p>

        <h1 class="important">Tiny human 2.0</h1>
            <p>Sam is currently 8 months pregnant with our second child.  Loretta Renee, who is named after my grandmother and my mother, will be here in May and I am officially outnumbered.
               Lately we have been spending a lot of time at Lowes and Home Depot buying things for her room.  Loretta will be born at <a href="https://www.progresswest.org">Progress West Hospital</a> just like her sister was.  Loretta could not have been born at a better time.  The company I 
               work for has started a paid parental leave for up to nine weeks for new parents beginning May 1st.  I told my wife she has to do everything possible to keep little Loretta in there till that date
               but we have already realized that Loretta does what she wants, when she wants.</p>
